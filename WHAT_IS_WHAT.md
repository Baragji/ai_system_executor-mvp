# WHAT IS WHAT - Category Clarification

> **Purpose:** This document prevents confusion between THE PRODUCT we're building vs THE WORKFLOW we use to build it.

**Read this first if you're ever confused about "what am I working on?"**

---

## TL;DR

**There are TWO separate things in this repository:**

1. **The Product:** An AI code generation system (Executor MVP)
2. **The Workflow:** How we developers work on that product (autonomous workflow system)

**They are NOT the same thing.** They use similar words ("orchestrator", "state", "autonomous") which causes confusion.

---

## THING 1: THE PRODUCT 🏗️

### Name
**Executor MVP** (also called "UMCA Executor MVP")

### What It Does
An AI-powered system that:
1. Takes a user prompt: _"Build a hello world app"_
2. Uses LLMs (GPT/Claude) to generate code
3. Validates generated code against schemas
4. **Automatically runs tests** on the generated code
5. **Auto-repairs** if tests fail (up to 3 attempts)
6. Serves output at `http://localhost:3000`

### Who Uses It
**End users** who want to generate code by describing what they want in natural language.

### Core Features
- **Clarification:** Asks follow-up questions if prompt is vague
- **Planning:** Breaks complex prompts into subtasks
- **Generation:** LLM-based code generation
- **Testing:** Automatic test execution in sandbox
- **Repair:** Multi-turn test failure fixes
- **Orchestration:** Coordinates the above steps

### Technology Stack (OF THE PRODUCT)
```
Language:   TypeScript/JavaScript ONLY
Backend:    Node.js 20+ with Express
Frontend:   Vanilla JS/CSS (no React/Vue/Angular)
Testing:    Vitest (for testing generated code)
LLMs:       OpenAI GPT / Anthropic Claude
Storage:    Local filesystem (./output/)
```

### Orchestration Modes (PRODUCT FEATURE)
**Mode 1 (Default):** **StepQueue** - Simple sequential execution
**Mode 2 (Beta):** **LangGraph** - Multi-agent orchestration (feature-flagged)

```bash
# Default mode
npm run dev

# LangGraph mode (beta)
AGENTS_RUNTIME=langgraph npm run dev
```

### Current Product Status
**Phase 19/20:** Trust Spine + LangGraph Foundation

**What This Means:**
- ✅ **T0 (Trust Spine) COMPLETE**
  - Enterprise observability (OpenTelemetry, SBOM, SLSA provenance)
  - RFC 9457 standardized errors
  - JSONL action logs

- ⏳ **M1/G3 (LangGraph Pilot) IN PROGRESS**
  - Multi-agent orchestration infrastructure
  - Async execution tracking
  - Feature-flagged runtime switching

## THING 2: THE WORKFLOW 📋

### Name
**Autonomous Workflow System** (also called "Developer Progression System")

### What It Does
Helps developers (humans + AI assistants) working ON the Executor MVP by answering:
1. **Where am I?** (current phase, completed tasks, gate status)
2. **What's done?** (task completion, evidence)
3. **What's next?** (suggested actions, gate advancement)

### Who Uses It
**Developers/AI agents** working on the Executor MVP codebase (that's us!)

### Core Features
- **State Snapshot:** `npm run state:show` - See current status in one command
- **Contract Tracking:** JSON contracts define phases and tasks
- **Gate System:** Quality gates (G0-G4) validate milestone completion
- **Evidence Collection:** SBOM, provenance, test reports
- **Autonomous Suggestions:** "what's next?" decision engine

### Technology Stack (OF THE WORKFLOW SYSTEM)
```
Process Docs:   Markdown (AGENTS.md, CLAUDE.md, etc.)
Contracts:      JSON schemas + Ajv validation
State Tracking: TypeScript modules + shell scripts
Evidence:       JSONL logs, SBOM files, test reports
```

### Workflow Phases (META-LEVEL TOOLS)
**Phase 1 (Complete):** Read-only snapshot system
**Phase 2 (Complete):** Contract status sync
**Phase 3 (Complete):** Orchestrator integration (wire state into runtime)
**Phase 4 (Complete):** Autonomous executor (auto-execute safe actions)

### Current Workflow Status
- ✅ **Phases 1-4 COMPLETE**
  - `npm run state:show` shows current workflow state
  - `npm run state:sync` syncs contract statuses
  - `GET /api/workflow/status` exposes workflow state via API
  - `npm run state:next` autonomously executes next action (interactive)
  - `npm run state:next:dry` shows what would be executed (dry-run)
  - `npm run state:next:auto` executes without confirmation (use with caution)

## THE CONFUSION: Where Things Get Mixed Up

### Similar Words, Different Meanings

| Word | In Product Context | In Workflow Context |
|------|-------------------|---------------------|
| **Orchestrator** | Execution engine (StepQueue/LangGraph) | Runtime integration (Phase 3) |
| **State** | Runtime execution state (CLARIFYING→DONE) | Meta-level progress (gates, tasks) |
| **Autonomous** | AI-powered code generation | Auto-execution of workflow actions |
| **LangGraph** | Product feature (multi-agent runtime) | NOT related to workflow |
| **Phase** | Product milestone (Phase 19/20) | Workflow enhancement (Phases 1-4) |

### The Category Error

**WRONG THINKING:** "We're on Phase 19, should we do Phases 3-4 before G3?"

**CORRECTED THINKING:**
- Phase 19 = PRODUCT milestone (Trust Spine)
- Phases 3-4 = WORKFLOW enhancements (autonomous tools)
- G3 = PRODUCT gate (LangGraph pilot)

**These are parallel tracks:**
```
PRODUCT TRACK:
├── Phase 19 T0 (Trust Spine) ✅ COMPLETE
├── Phase 19 M1/G3 (LangGraph Pilot) ⏳ PARTIAL
└── Phase 19 U1/G4 (HITL/MCP) 🔜 NOT STARTED

WORKFLOW TRACK:
├── Phase 1 (Snapshot) ✅ COMPLETE
├── Phase 2 (Sync) ✅ COMPLETE
├── Phase 3 (Integration) ✅ COMPLETE
└── Phase 4 (Autonomous Executor) ✅ COMPLETE
```

## Quick Decision Guide

### "Should I work on X next?"

**Ask yourself:** Is X about...
- **The product's functionality?** → PRODUCT TRACK
- **How we developers work?** → WORKFLOW TRACK

**Examples:**

| Task | Category | Track | Status |
|------|----------|-------|--------|
| Implement LangGraph parity tests | PRODUCT | G3 (Orchestrator Pilot) | ⏳ Next |
| Wire state into `/api/progress` endpoint | WORKFLOW | Phase 3 (Integration) | ✅ Done |
| Add autonomous action executor | WORKFLOW | Phase 4 (Executor) | ✅ Done |
| Measure LangGraph p50 overhead | PRODUCT | G3 (Orchestrator Pilot) | ⏳ Next |
| Auto-commit passing tests | WORKFLOW | Phase 4 (Executor) | ✅ Done |
| Implement HITL approval UI | PRODUCT | U1/G4 (Future) | 🔜 Future |

### "What should I work on next?"

**Current Status (2025-10-15):**
- ✅ **WORKFLOW track COMPLETE** (Phases 1-4)
- ⏳ **PRODUCT G3 ready** (Trust Spine complete, workflow automation in place)

**Recommended Next Step:**
→ Advance PRODUCT G3 (LangGraph Orchestrator Pilot)
   - Implement LangGraph parity tests
   - Measure p50 overhead (target: < 500ms)
   - Validate coverage ≥ 90%
   - Update GATES_LEDGER to mark G3 as PASSED

## Common Questions

### Q: What is "Phase 19"?
**A:** A PRODUCT milestone. "Trust Spine + LangGraph Foundation" for the Executor MVP.

### Q: What are "Phases 3-4"?
**A:** WORKFLOW enhancements to the autonomous developer progression system.

### Q: What is "LangGraph"?
**A:** A PRODUCT feature - multi-agent orchestration runtime for code generation.

### Q: What is "orchestrator integration" (Phase 3)?
**A:** WORKFLOW enhancement - wiring workflow state into the product's runtime endpoints.

## How to Use This Document

### When Starting a New Task
1. Check if task is PRODUCT or WORKFLOW
2. Look at the appropriate track's status
3. Understand dependencies within that track
4. Avoid conflating the two tracks

### When Confused
1. Re-read the "TL;DR" section
2. Check the "Similar Words, Different Meanings" table
3. Use the "Quick Decision Guide"

### When Planning
1. PRODUCT track: Follow contract gates (G0→G1→G2→G3→G4)
2. WORKFLOW track: Follow enhancement phases (1→2→3→4)
3. Remember: These can progress in parallel

## Current Status (2025-10-14)

### PRODUCT: Executor MVP
**Phase:** 19/20 (Trust Spine + LangGraph Foundation)
**Status:** T0 Complete ✅, G3 Pending ⏳
**Next:** Implement G3 Orchestrator Pilot acceptance criteria

### WORKFLOW: Autonomous System
**Phase:** 1-2 Complete, 3-4 Pending
**Status:** Snapshot + Sync Working ✅, Integration Pending ⏳
**Next:** Wire workflow state into product runtime (Phase 3)

### Recommendation
**Finish WORKFLOW Phases 3-4, THEN advance PRODUCT G3**

**Rationale:**
- Workflow system solves the original problem ("what's next?" confusion)
- Small investment (3-5 hours) for permanent clarity
- Makes G3 development smoother with autonomous tools
- Prevents this category confusion from recurring
